# 📡 Wi-Fi Network Configuration & Wireless Technology

## 🌍 Home Network Overview

- Most home networks consist of two parts: a **public network** from the service provider and a **private LAN** managed by a router.
- Routers often support **both wired (Ethernet) and wireless (Wi-Fi) connections**.
- Devices such as desktops, gaming systems, smart TVs, printers, security cameras, and IoT devices connect to home networks.

## 📶 Wireless LAN (WLAN) Technology

- Uses **electromagnetic waves** to transmit data.
- Operates in **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz** frequency bands.
- **802.11 standards** (Wi-Fi) regulate wireless communication.
- **Wi-Fi Alliance** ensures device compatibility.
- Offers advantages like **mobility, flexibility, scalability, and cost savings**.

## 🏡 Home & Small Business Routers

- Have **Ethernet** and **Internet** ports.
- Some include **built-in wireless access points (APs)**.
- **Wireless Standards:** 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax.
- **Legacy Mode:** Allows older devices to connect.

## 📡 Wireless Network Configuration

- **Network Mode:** Supports 802.11b/g/n or **Mixed Mode** for compatibility.
- **SSID (Network Name):** Identifies the WLAN; devices must use the same SSID.
- **Channel Selection:** Default is **Auto**, but can be manually set.
- **SSID Broadcast:** Enabled by default; disabling it hides the network.

## 🔑 Security & Authentication

- **SSID should not include model/brand info** to avoid security risks.
- **Passphrase (Wi-Fi Password):** Used for authentication and encryption.
- **Encryption Standards:** WPA2 or higher recommended.
- **MAC Address Filtering:** Restricts access to specific devices.
- **Guest Network:** Allows internet access without full network privileges.

## 📶 Wireless Connectivity Technologies

### **Wi-Fi** 🔗

- Enables internet access over **wireless local area networks (WLANs)**.
- Can be secured using **encryption protocols**.

### **Bluetooth** 🔵

- Short-range wireless communication technology.
- Used for **pairing** with peripherals like **headsets, keyboards, speakers**.

### **NFC (Near Field Communication)** 📲

- Works within a few centimeters.
- Used in **contactless payments** and **device-to-device file sharing**.

## 🛡️ Best Practices for Wi-Fi Security

✔️ Avoid sending **login credentials in plaintext**.
✔️ Use a **VPN** for added security.
✔️ Enable **WPA2/WPA3 encryption**.
✔️ Regularly update router firmware.
✔️ Set up **firewalls and disable WPS** (Wi-Fi Protected Setup).

## 🔌 Wired vs. Wireless Connections

- **Ethernet (Wired)**: More reliable and faster; uses **Category 5e/6 cables**.
- **Powerline Networking**: Uses electrical wiring to extend wired network access.
- **Wi-Fi (Wireless)**: Offers mobility but can be affected by interference.

## 🌐 Additional Considerations

- Some routers feature **automatic setup utilities**.
- **Dynamic IP Addressing**: Most routers assign IPs via **DHCP**.
- **Firmware Updates**: Ensures security and performance improvements.

🛠️ **Configuring your router properly ensures a secure and efficient network!** 🚀
