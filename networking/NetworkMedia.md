# Network Media Types

## Introduction

Network media refers to the communication channels used to transmit data between devices in a network. The choice of media affects the speed, reliability, and overall performance of a network.

## Types of Network Media

Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices:

1. **Metal Wires within Cables**
   - Data is transmitted as electrical impulses.
   - Commonly used in **twisted-pair** and **coaxial cables**.
2. **Glass or Plastic Fibers within Cables (Fiber-Optic Cable)**
   - Data is transmitted using pulses of light.
   - Offers **high-speed transmission** over long distances.
   - Immune to **electromagnetic interference (EMI)**.
3. **Wireless Transmission**

   - Data is transmitted using **radio waves, microwaves, or infrared signals**.
   - Used in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and satellite communications.

## Criteria for Choosing Network Media

When selecting a network medium, consider the following factors:

1. **Maximum Distance** - How far the media can carry a signal without significant loss.
2. **Environmental Factors** - Suitability for indoor/outdoor installation and resistance to interference.
3. **Data Transmission Speed** - The amount of data that needs to be transmitted and the required speed.
4. **Cost** - The expense of purchasing, installing, and maintaining the media.

## Common Types of Network Cables

1. **Twisted-Pair Cable** (Used in Ethernet)

   - Consists of pairs of copper wires twisted together to reduce interference.
   - Used in **LANs (Local Area Networks)**.

2. **Coaxial Cable** (Used in Cable TV & Internet)

   - Consists of a single copper conductor with shielding to reduce interference.
   - Used in broadband communication and satellite systems.

3. **Fiber-Optic Cable** (Used for High-Speed Networks)
   - Made of glass or plastic fibers as thin as human hair.
   - Provides **high bandwidth** and **long-distance communication**.
   - Immune to **electrical interference**, making it ideal for industrial and high-performance networks.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right network media is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable communication. Each type of media has its advantages and limitations, making it important to select based on the specific needs of the network.
