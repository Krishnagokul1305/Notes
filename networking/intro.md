## Intro

A network is a system of interconnected devices or nodes that communicate with each other to share data, resources, and services

### Examples of Networks:

- The Internet (a massive global network).
- A home Wi-Fi network connecting phones, laptops, and smart devices.
- A corporate network linking employees to shared files and servers.

## Common Methods of Data Transmission

- Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- Optical signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- Wireless signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.

## Bandwidth and throughput

### Bandwidth (Maximum Capacity)

- The maximum amount of data that can be transferred in a given time.
- Think of it like a highway:
  -  A wide highway (high bandwidth) allows more cars (data) to travel at once.
  -  A narrow highway (low bandwidth) allows fewer cars, causing congestion.
- Example: A 100 Mbps internet connection has higher bandwidth than a 10 Mbps connection.

### Throughput (Actual Speed)

- The actual amount of data transferred in a given time.
- Think of it like traffic flow:
  -  Even if the highway is wide (high bandwidth), if there’s a traffic jam (network issues), the actual cars moving (throughput) will be lower.
- Example: You have 100 Mbps bandwidth, but due to network congestion, your actual speed (throughput) might be 50 Mbps.

## Type of data

1. Volunteered Data (Shared by You)
2. Observed Data (Collected Automatically)
3. Inferred Data (Predicted from Other Data)

| Data Type            | Description                                                | Examples                                                                                                                                     | Key Point                                                                   |

| **Volunteered Data** | Data you directly provide when using online services.      | - Signing up for Facebook with name, email, etc. <br> - Filling out a job application online. <br> - Uploading a selfie on Instagram.        | You are aware that you are sharing this data.                               |
| **Observed Data**    | Data collected automatically based on your activities.     | - Google Maps tracking your location. <br> - YouTube tracking your watch history. <br> - Online stores tracking product views and purchases. | You don’t type this data; it’s collected based on your actions.             |
| **Inferred Data**    | Data generated by analyzing volunteered and observed data. | - Credit score calculation. <br> - Netflix recommending movies. <br> - Fraud detection by banks.                                             | You never directly entered this data, but it is generated using algorithms. |
