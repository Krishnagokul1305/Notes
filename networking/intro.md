## 🔹 Intro  

A **network** is a system of interconnected devices or nodes that communicate with each other to share **data, resources, and services**.  

### 🌍 Examples of Networks:  

- 🌎 **The Internet** – A massive global network.  
- 🏡 **Home Wi-Fi Network** – Connects phones, laptops, and smart devices.  
- 🏢 **Corporate Network** – Links employees to shared files and servers.

## 🔀 Common Methods of Data Transmission  

- ⚡ **Electrical Signals** – Data is represented as electrical pulses on copper wire.  
- 💡 **Optical Signals** – Data is converted into light pulses for transmission.  
- 📡 **Wireless Signals** – Uses infrared, microwave, or radio waves to transmit data through the air.

## 📶 Bandwidth and Throughput  

### ⚡ Bandwidth (Maximum Capacity)  

- The **maximum amount of data** that can be transferred in a given time.  
- Think of it like a **highway**:  
  - 🛣️ A **wide highway** (high bandwidth) allows more cars (data) to travel at once.  
  - 🚧 A **narrow highway** (low bandwidth) allows fewer cars, causing congestion.  
- 🏎️ **Example:** A **100 Mbps** internet connection has higher bandwidth than a **10 Mbps** connection.  

### 🚀 Throughput (Actual Speed)  

- The **actual amount of data** transferred in a given time.  
- Think of it like **traffic flow**:  
  - 🚗 Even if the highway is wide (**high bandwidth**), if there’s a traffic jam (**network issues**), the actual cars moving (**throughput**) will be lower.  
- ⚠️ **Example:** You have **100 Mbps bandwidth**, but due to **network congestion**, your actual speed (**throughput**) might be **50 Mbps**.

## 📊 Type of Data  

1️⃣ **Volunteered Data** (Shared by You)  
2️⃣ **Observed Data** (Collected Automatically)  
3️⃣ **Inferred Data** (Predicted from Other Data)  

| 📂 **Data Type**       | 🔍 **Description**                                        | 📝 **Examples**                                                                                                                                 | 📌 **Key Point**                                                 |

| **📝 Volunteered Data** | Data you **directly provide** when using online services. | - ✍️ Signing up for Facebook with name, email, etc. <br> - 📝 Filling out a job application online. <br> - 📸 Uploading a selfie on Instagram. | ✅ You are **aware** that you are sharing this data.             |
| **👀 Observed Data**    | Data **collected automatically** based on your activities. | - 📍 Google Maps tracking your location. <br> - 🎥 YouTube tracking your watch history. <br> - 🛍️ Online stores tracking product views & purchases. | ⚠️ You **don’t type** this data; it’s collected **based on your actions**. |
| **🤖 Inferred Data**    | Data **generated by analyzing** volunteered & observed data. | - 💳 Credit score calculation. <br> - 🎬 Netflix recommending movies. <br> - 🏦 Fraud detection by banks. | 🔮 You **never directly entered** this data, but it is **generated using algorithms**. |
