## 🖥️ Client & Server  

### 🔹 Host  

- All computers connected to a network that participate directly in **network communication** are classified as **hosts**.  
- Hosts can **send and receive** messages on the network.  
- A computer host can act as a **client, a server, or both**.

## 🔄 Server vs Client  

| 🔍 **Feature**      | 🖥️ **Server**                           | 💻 **Client**                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Role**           | Provides services/data                 | Requests services/data           |
| **Examples**       | Web server, Database server, File server | Laptops, Phones, Web browsers    |
| **Works Alone?**   | Always running, waiting for requests   | Needs a server to get data       |

## 🔄 Ways Computers Communicate in a Network  

Computers in a network communicate in two main ways:  

### **1️⃣ Client-Server Architecture** 🖥️ → 💻💻💻  

#### 🔹 How it Works:  

- A **central server** manages data, services, and resources.  
- **Clients** (computers, phones) send requests to the server.  
- The **server processes** the request and sends back the response.  

#### 🔹 Examples:  

✅ **Web Browsing** – You type **www.google.com**, and Google’s server sends you the webpage.  
✅ **Email Services** – Gmail stores your emails on a **server**, and you access them from any device.  
✅ **Online Games** – A **game server** handles multiplayer matches, and players (**clients**) connect to it.  

📌 **Think of it like a Restaurant:**  

- **Server (Kitchen)** prepares and delivers food.  
- **Clients (Customers)** order food and receive it.  

---

### **2️⃣ Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture** 💻 ↔ 💻 ↔ 💻  

#### 🔹 How it Works:  

- No **central server** – all devices (**peers**) are equal and share resources directly.  
- Each device acts as **both a client and a server**.  

#### 🔹 Examples:  

✅ **File Sharing** – **Torrent downloads** (BitTorrent) allow users to share files directly.  
✅ **Local Network Gaming** – Two players connect **directly** without a game server.  
✅ **Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies** – **Bitcoin transactions** are processed by multiple peers (**nodes**).  

📌 **Think of it like a Group Study:**  

- Each student (**peer**) shares notes directly instead of asking a teacher (**server**).

### 🔍 **Key Differences**  

| 🔍 **Feature**     | 🖥️ **Client-Server**                 | 💻 **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Control**      | Central server manages everything  | No central control, all peers are equal |
| **Data Storage** | Stored on a **server**             | **Distributed** among peers     |
| **Speed**        | Faster & **reliable** for large networks | Slower as **more peers join**   |
| **Examples**     | Websites, Email, Online Games      | Torrents, Local Sharing, Blockchain |

## 🏗️ Network Infrastructure  

| **Category**             | **Description**                                      | **Examples**                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **📱 End Devices**        | Devices that users interact with to access the network. | Computers, Smartphones, Printers, Smart TVs       |
| **🛠️ Intermediate Devices** | Devices that **manage network traffic and connectivity**. | Routers, Switches, Modems, Access Points, Firewalls |
| **🔗 Network Media**      | The **medium** used to transfer data between devices. | Ethernet, Fiber Optic, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular |
