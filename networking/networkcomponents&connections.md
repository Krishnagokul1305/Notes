## Client & Server

### Host

- All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts.
- Hosts can send and receive messages on the network.
- computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both.

## Server vs Client

| Feature          | Server 🖥️                                | Client 💻                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Role**         | Provides services/data                   | Requests services/data        |
| **Examples**     | Web server, Database server, File server | Laptops, Phones, Web browsers |
| **Works Alone?** | Always running, waiting for requests     | Needs a server to get data    |

## Ways Computers Communicate in a Network

Computers in a network communicate in two main ways:

### 1️⃣ Client-Server Architecture 🖥️ → 💻💻💻

#### 🔹 How it Works:

- A central server manages data, services, and resources.
- Clients (computers, phones) send requests to the server.
- The server processes the request and sends back the response.

#### 🔹 Examples:

✅ **Web Browsing** – You type www.google.com, and Google’s server sends you the webpage.  
✅ **Email Services** – Gmail stores your emails on a server, and you access them from any device.  
✅ **Online Games** – A game server handles multiplayer matches, and players (clients) connect to it.

📌 **Think of it like a Restaurant:**

- **Server (Kitchen)** prepares and delivers food.
- **Clients (Customers)** order food and receive it.

### 2️⃣ Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture 💻 ↔ 💻 ↔ 💻

#### 🔹 How it Works:

- No central server – all devices (peers) are equal and share resources directly.
- Each device acts as both a client and a server.

#### 🔹 Examples:

✅ **File Sharing** – Torrent downloads (BitTorrent) allow users to share files directly.  
✅ **Local Network Gaming** – Two players connect directly without a game server.  
✅ **Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies** – Bitcoin transactions are processed by multiple peers (nodes).

📌 **Think of it like a Group Study:**

- Each student (peer) shares notes directly instead of asking a teacher (server).

### 🔍 Key Differences:

| Feature          | Client-Server 🖥️→💻                  | Peer-to-Peer (P2P) 💻↔💻                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Control**      | Central server manages everything    | No central control, all peers are equal |
| **Data Storage** | Stored on a server                   | Distributed among peers                 |
| **Speed**        | Faster & reliable for large networks | Slower as more peers join               |
| **Examples**     | Websites, Email, Online Games        | Torrents, Local Sharing, Blockchain     |

## 🌐 Network Infrastructure

| Category                 | Description                                             | Examples                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **End Devices**          | Devices that users interact with to access the network. | Computers, Smartphones, Printers, Smart TVs         |
| **Intermediate Devices** | Devices that manage network traffic and connectivity.   | Routers, Switches, Modems, Access Points, Firewalls |
| **Network Media**        | The medium used to transfer data between devices.       | Ethernet, Fiber Optic, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular   |
